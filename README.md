# Medical_Students_Dataset

## Introduction ##
I have a dirty Medical students dataset to clean and visualize to gain insight.
The aim of the project is to draw conclusions from the dataset to help the company make informed decisions.

Below is a snippet of the data set:

## Activities ##
1. Data cleaning
2. pivot tables
3. visualization

## Questions to answer ##
Using the Medical Students Data, create Pivot Tables displaying the following:
1. Average values for the following for Males and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol)
2. Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places)
3. Number of students across the different Blood Groups
4. Number of Students who smoke and those who don’t
5. Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don’t
6. Visualize the insights gotten from the Pivot Tables created using the ‘Medical Students’ Data

 ## Answers ##   
First of all, I had to remove duplicates, then I went on to filter out the blank cell and fill up the blanks with the average of the column set.
Then I calculated the BMI value by dividing the weight cell by the square of the Height cell and then multiplied by 10,000.
At the end of the clean-up, I arrived at the clean dataset below;

From the cleaned dataset, I answered the above-given questions and created the pivot tables as shown below;
